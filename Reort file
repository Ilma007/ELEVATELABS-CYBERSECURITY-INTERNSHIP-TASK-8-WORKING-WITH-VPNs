‚úÖ Step-by-Step Task Execution

Step 1 ‚Äì Choose a Free VPN
Selected ProtonVPN (Free Tier) due to its good privacy policy and secure infrastructure.

Step 2 ‚Äì Create Account & Install Client

Went to https://protonvpn.com/

Clicked Get ProtonVPN Free

Registered using email and verified the address

Downloaded the Windows/Android application

Installed the client and logged in

Step 3 ‚Äì Connect to VPN Server

Launched ProtonVPN client

From the list of free servers, selected the nearest server (India ‚Äì Free Server)

Clicked Connect ‚Üí VPN connection successfully established

Step 4 ‚Äì Verify IP Address

Opened browser and visited https://whatismyipaddress.com

Noted down original IP before connection

Verified that IP has changed after enabling VPN
üëâ IP location showing Switzerland (Proton server) instead of actual location.

Step 5 ‚Äì Confirm Encrypted Traffic

Visited https://www.google.com <br>

Used browser‚Äôs lock icon to check ‚ÄúConnection is secure‚Äù

All requests are HTTPS encrypted and routed through VPN

Step 6 ‚Äì Disconnect VPN and Compare

Disconnected from ProtonVPN

Reloaded whatismyipaddress.com

IP reverted to original

Slight increase in speed after disconnect (VPN connection had ~15-20% slower browsing)

Step 7 ‚Äì Research VPN Encryption & Privacy Features

ProtonVPN uses AES-256 encryption, Perfect Forward Secrecy, OpenVPN/IKEv2 protocols

Includes no-log policy and Secure Core (routing via multiple servers for extra protection)

Step 8 ‚Äì Summary ‚Äì VPN Benefits & Limitations

Benefits:
‚Ä¢ Protects identity and hides IP
‚Ä¢ Encrypts internet traffic
‚Ä¢ Protects on public Wi-Fi
‚Ä¢ Useful to bypass geo-restrictions

Limitations:
‚Ä¢ Free tier servers may be limited and slow
‚Ä¢ Some websites block traffic from VPN IPs
‚Ä¢ VPN cannot protect against phishing/malware

üìù Report ‚Äì Working with VPNs (Task 8)

Objective:
To understand and practically experience the use of VPNs in protecting privacy and securing online communication.

Tools Used:
ProtonVPN (Free Tier)

Steps Performed:

Selected ProtonVPN as a reputable free VPN service and created a free account.

Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client application.

Opened the application and connected to a nearby VPN server (Free India Server).

Verified change in IP address using whatismyipaddress.com. The displayed IP location changed, confirming successful VPN connection.

Accessed a secure website and verified that traffic was encrypted via HTTPS and routed through the VPN tunnel.

Disconnected from VPN and rechecked the IP to observe the reversal to original address. Also experienced a slightly faster browsing speed after disconnection.

Researched ProtonVPN features and found that it uses AES-256 encryption, OpenVPN/IKEv2 protocols, no log policy, and offers Secure Core architecture for enhanced privacy.

Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations:

Benefits	Limitations
Masks IP address and hides user identity	Free servers can be slow
Encrypts all network traffic	Limited server locations in free version
Offers safety when using public Wi-Fi	Certain websites block VPN access
Helps in bypassing geo-restricted sites	Does not protect against malicious websites/phishing

Outcome:
Through this hands-on exercise, I gained practical experience in installing and using a VPN. I verified IP masking and encryption of traffic. I also understood how VPNs enhance online privacy and the limitations of free VPN services.
