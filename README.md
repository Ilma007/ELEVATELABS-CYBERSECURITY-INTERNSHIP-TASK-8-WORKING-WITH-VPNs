# ELEVATELABS-CYBERSECURITY-INTERNSHIP-TASK-8-WORKING-WITH-VPNs

Objective:
To understand and practically experience the use of VPNs in protecting privacy and securing online communication.

Tools Used:
ProtonVPN (Free Tier)

Steps Performed:

Selected ProtonVPN as a reputable free VPN service and created a free account.

Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client application.

Opened the application and connected to a nearby VPN server (Free India Server).

Verified change in IP address using whatismyipaddress.com. The displayed IP location changed, confirming successful VPN connection.

Accessed a secure website and verified that traffic was encrypted via HTTPS and routed through the VPN tunnel.

Disconnected from VPN and rechecked the IP to observe the reversal to original address. Also experienced a slightly faster browsing speed after disconnection.

Researched ProtonVPN features and found that it uses AES-256 encryption, OpenVPN/IKEv2 protocols, no log policy, and offers Secure Core architecture for enhanced privacy.

Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations:

Benefits	Limitations
Masks IP address and hides user identity	Free servers can be slow
Encrypts all network traffic	Limited server locations in free version
Offers safety when using public Wi-Fi	Certain websites block VPN access
Helps in bypassing geo-restricted sites	Does not protect against malicious websites/phishing

Outcome:
Through this hands-on exercise, I gained practical experience in installing and using a VPN. I verified IP masking and encryption of traffic. I also understood how VPNs enhance online privacy and the limitations of free VPN services.
